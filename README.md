# 🦴 MegaBonk Battle Arena — Version 2.0.1  
**A turn-based console battle game developed entirely in C# (.NET 8)**  
**Created by Tezas (Dimos Ioannis)**  
> Second major version of the project — evolved from the original prototype made within **10 days of learning C#**

---

## 🎮 Overview
**MegaBonk Battle Arena v2.0.1** is an upgraded **turn-based console fighting game** that blends **tactical decision-making**, **character abilities**, and **cinematic ASCII-style animations**.  
Each fighter has distinct traits, bonuses, and effects that interact dynamically through a balanced “rock-paper-scissors” inspired combat system.

This version improves:
- Combat balance  
- Buff and parry mechanics  
- Dodge and dizzy interactions  
- Character-specific animations  
- Console clarity and timing effects

## ⚔️ Battle System
Every round follows synchronized **turn resolution** logic:

1. Both player and CPU select **Attack** or **Defend**.  
2. Defense applies first (block + reflection).  
3. Attacks resolve at the same time.  
4. Special effects (stun, dizzy, dodge, armor buffs) apply immediately within the same turn.

### ⚙️ Core Rules
- **Defend:** halves incoming damage and reflects **40–65%**.  
- **Stun/Dizzy:** cancels the opponent’s attack on the same turn.  
- **Defend overrides** any stun/dizzy.  
- **Parry damage** scales dynamically based on attack power.  
- Real-time **text animations** and effects per action.
